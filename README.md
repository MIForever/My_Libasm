## Task

The task is to write some foundamental functions of C programming language in nasm 64 version of assembly programming language.

## Description

There wasn't a single video on Youtube about nasm 64. We barely find some information on internet. The rest of it we searched online books.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded it you make it using makefile which creates executable binaries that starts with "execute_my" in the parent directory

## Usage

You can change, play around with <b>.c</b> files located in <i>source_c</i> folder and remake it using make command.
Once the executables built, you can get the outputs by just running them
```
make
```
After building enter:
```
./execute_my_*
```
