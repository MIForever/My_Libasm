# Welcome to My Libasm

---

## Task

The task is to write some fundamental functions of C programming language in the NASM x64 version of assembly programming language.

## Description

There wasn't a single video on YouTube about Nasm 64. We barely find any information on the internet. For the rest of it, we searched online books.

## Installation

Once you have downloaded it you make it using makefile which creates executable binaries that start with "execute_my" in the parent directory

## Usage

You can change, play around with <b>.c</b> files located in <i>source_c</i> folder and remake it using the make command.
Once the executables are built, you can get the outputs by just running them
```
make
```
After building enter:
```
./execute_my_*
```
